STAT3105 Machine Learning Project with Wayne Lee

project2.Rmd contains the entirety of my code that was used for data wrangling, modelling, and creating algorithm.


algorithm.R is the main algorithm whose only function is to predict paths of the target when the user feeds in an initial point (a single point consisting of latitude, longitude, and timestamp)


trainingdata.csv is the training data I used for modelling and for creating the algorithm. The user MUST load this wrangled dataset into the algorithm to make it work.
